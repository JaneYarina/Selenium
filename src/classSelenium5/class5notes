Handling checkboxes and radioboxes
checkbox you can chose multiple
in radiobox you can chose only one
--if you only have one checkbox or 1 radiobox you just click() on it
--if you have multiple boxes we store in a list , loop through them , depend on condition you perform an action
 1) List<WebElement> allLinks = driver.findElements(By.tagName("a"));// we store everything in a list
 2) for (WebElement link : allLinks) {//we llopthroigh each of them
 3) if (!linkText.isEmpty()) {//we had an condition
 4) System.out.println(linkText+" "+fulLink);//final action

 @)list is an interface  - a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact(interact with )
the place at which independent and often unrelated systems meet and act on or communicate with each other

@)The return type of findElements is a list whereas the return type of findElement is a WebElement.
If there is no matching element on the page, an exception is thrown by the findElement method. In this scenario,
an empty list id returned by the findElements method.

Dropdown itis the mennue that gives us oppotunity to sellect one ore more options
2 types of dropdowns:
1) single select
2) multiple select
Mandling dropdowns:
mandling(manipulirovanie)
1. click on dropdown and click on option
2. using Select Class in SElenium

In order to use Select class
make sure that our dropdown has a selected tag


Selecting an option can be done in 3 ways:
1. by Index
2. by visible text
3. by value

Whenever you interact with multiple elements you store them inside the container such as List, Set....

In order to deselect your DD is multiple select
--Make sure your DD is multipele select
deselectByValue()
deselectByIndex()
deselectByVisobleText()
deselectAll()

without Select class you cant manipulate with getOption()
options are webelelments that is why we store them inside the List of Webelement


what is scriped - 1) In computer programming, a script is a program or sequence of instructions
that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor
(as a compiled program is). Some languages have been conceived expressly as script languages.


!)before identyfy the class
identify dropdown as a webElement inside the scripted

?????????????????????What is List<String> list=new ArrayList<String>();????????????????????????????????????????
List is an interface. List<String> list=new ArrayList<String>();
Here, lets say we are creating a reference variable of list interface and assigning it to the ArrayList object
 which implemets List interface.
Lets say if we want to get the size of the list. We will use list.size()
which will internally invoke the size() method of ArrayList object using Runtime Polymorphism.
Simply here what I mean to say is the methods of List is implemented in ArrayList class
thats why we are able to use it.
??????????????????????????????????????iteration??????????????????????????????????????
In Java, iteration is a technique used to sequence through a block of code repeatedly until a specific
condition either exists or no longer exists. Iterations are a very common approach used with loops.
