Handling multiple windows(tabs):
In order to handle multiple windows we will be uasing:
getWindowHandle()
getgWindoeHandles()

WindowHandle:
is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab
It is approximately a 40 alphanimeric characters ID

the original page where you navigate will be called parent handle
and additional tab opened afteward will be called child handle


Most of the time when you interact with new links they will open a new tab or a window

 when you need to identify make shure to pay attention at spaces. By text not need spases between and after  even if they
 been copied, but in xpath by text we need spaces if they are copied together with text

 Synchronization:
 is the process of brining the speed of two or more components to the same level
 in this case we a brining our script and page load to the same speed level

 Tread.sleep() - static wait/ unconditional wait

 Types of selenium waits:
 Implicit wait
 Explict wait
 Fluent wait

 Implicit Wait(global wait):
 it tells the webdriver to wait untill certain amount of time before throwing an exception
 it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
 We ca say the Implicit wait is a global wait

 Implicit wait works with findElement() method

 Implicit wait is usually set for 20 seconds. If your element is found in any time between the given time
 the remaining time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or to the next step
 if the element is not found in the given time ,only then you will get an exception
 only use to find element method
