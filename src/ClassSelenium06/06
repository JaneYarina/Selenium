Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are on.
We cannot proceed further until it is handled

1) web Based alerts/HTML Alerts - we can simply inspect alerts and perform needed actions
2) javascript Alert/ browser alert - not a port og a webpage .It is a part of the browser .

1) simple alert - click ok
2)confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
