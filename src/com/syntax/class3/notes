//input[@type = 'text']
comand F for mack to open html window
//a[text() = 'Create new account']
//input[contains(@placeholder,'Email')]

to open selecter box for xpath:
mac comand f
windows control f


Syntax for relative xpath:
//input[]  - by using [] we are identyfing tag name
input - is a tag name
attribute ? @ID
value of ID is email
//input[@id='email']
1of 1  - unick
1 of 2 you cant use in the code it will be able to bring us to the wrong place
//input[@type = 'text']


identify element by it text():
//tagname[text() = 'text value']
//a[text() = 'Create new account']
//h2[text() = 'Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']

contains method:
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
//input[contains(@placeholder,'Email')]   - by using @ and then attribute
//h2[contains(text(), 'the world')]  - by using text()


starts-with will identify elements by its partial starting value:
//tagname[starts-with(@aria-label, 'Email')]
//input[starts-with(@aria-label, 'Email')] face book

ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.09 and this method is not available



 Advanced Xpath:
 is based on parent and child, sibling relationship

 1)Identifying element by following sibling:
( "body "on facebook log in page is a following sibling)
 //tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibking::siblingTagname
 e.g. //input[@id='calFromDate']/following-sibling::img  from sytax webpage

 2)identifying element by preceding siblings
 //tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::siblingTagname
 //span[text()='& Orders']/preseding-sibling::span   from amazon page

 3)identify by parent
 //tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent::parentTagname
 //span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

 4)identifying elements by ancestors:
 //tagname[@attribute ='attrribute value']/ancestor::ancestorTagname
 //input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

5) identifying element5s by its index:
(//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value'])[index]  1 of 2
(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2] from sytex page
